Items marked $${\color{red}red}$$ if purchase date is 2 years and 6 months or more ago.
Items marked $${\color{magenta}magenta}$$ if purchase date is 2 years and 3 months or more ago.
Spec says $${\color{yellow}yellow}$$ should be used but it is hard to see when you have white background in terminal/console. 

Locale set to *"en-US"* because *LiveCurrency* class depends on a data source that uses "." decimal notation.
